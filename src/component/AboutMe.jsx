        engaging video content that aligned with the company&apos;s brand and
        marketing objectives. My skills include managing video projects,
        pre-production planning, on-set coordination, and post-production
        editing. </div>
      <br/> <div> In addition to my professional experience, I have completed
        several certifications, including Technical Support Fundamentals, The
        Fundamentals of Digital Marketing, Programming for Everybody (Getting
        Started with Python), Ecology: from cells to Gaia, and The Strategy of
        Content Marketing. I recently completed a four-month Full Stack Bootcamp with TechUp, gaining a toolkit of web development skills. </div>  <br/> <div> I hold a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Biology from Mahidol University. With my passion for photography and
        videography, as well as my academic knowledge in Science, I am
        eager to contribute my skills and experience to the field.</div> <br/>
